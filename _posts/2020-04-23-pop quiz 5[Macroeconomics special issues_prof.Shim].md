### Why the developing countries show higher variability in consumption relative to output than the developed countries?  {#why-the-developing-countries-show-higher-variability-in-consumption-relative-to-output-than-the-developed-countries .unnumbered}

Neumeyer and Perri(2005) focused fundamental issues in each countries to
unravel the role of fluctuation in the real interests rates faced by
these countries. They suggested several issues, such as foreign rates,
contagion, or political factors, as fundamental issues in each
countries. Also, they explored with two ways of modeling the interest
rate: one as a process entirely blocked the fundamental shocks hitting
the countries and the other as a process largely influenced by those
shocks. Thus, they concluded that real interest rates induced by by
fundamental shocks magnify the effect of fundamental shocks on business
cycle, contributing to the high volatility. In addtion, their further
research revealed that eliminating default risk in emerging economies
can reduce 27% of their volatility.

Thus, we can deduce that the emerging countries comparably vulnerable in
fundamental are more sensitive to the fluctuations in interest rates
induced by fundamental shocks than the developed countries, which
results in the high variability in consumption relative to output in
emerging countries.
