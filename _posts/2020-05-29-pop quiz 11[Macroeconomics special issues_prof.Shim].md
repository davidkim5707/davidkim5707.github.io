## Conditions for king plosser and rebelo utility preference 

$$\begin{aligned}
u(C,L) &= \frac{1}{1-\sigma}C^{1-\sigma} + \nu(L) & if \ 0<\sigma<1 \ or \ \sigma>1
\\ u(C,L) &= log(C) + \nu(L) & if \ \sigma=1.\end{aligned}$$

It is required that $\nu(L)$ is increasing and concave when the utility
is additively separable. When the utility is multiplicatively separable,
then it is required that $(i) \ \nu(L)$ is increasing and concave if
$\sigma<1$ and decreasing and convex if $\sigma>1.$ Further, it is also
required to assure overall concavity of utility function that
$\sigma[L\nu^{''}(L)/\nu^{'}(L)] > (1-\sigma)[L\nu^{'}(L)/\nu(L)]$.

For balanced growth, utility must be such that there are exactly
offsetting income and substitution effects of the changes in real wages
associated with sustained growth in productivity. In a static framework
with no-wage income, this invariance arises whenever utility if overall
concave.
