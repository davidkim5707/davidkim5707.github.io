### Derive standard deviations 


To observe the volatilities of Macro variables in aggregate level in
South Korea, I used real gdp index, Consumption index, and real
investment index from BOK for the period of 1970-2019. I derive real
investment index by dividing nominal investment index with producer
price index(ppi). All variables are quarterly and detrended by
HP-filter.

   variable     s.d
  ---------- ----------
      Y       .0621624
      C       .0410235
      I       .2398146

  : Standard Deviation

In Table 1, the standard deviation of consumption is smaller than that
of GDP. The standard deviation of Investment is far larger than other
variables.
