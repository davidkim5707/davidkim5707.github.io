## Observe comovements of Macro variables in South Korea 

To observe the volatilities of Macro variables in aggregate level in
South Korea, I used real gdp index, Consumption index, real investment
index from BOK, and total hours index from Penn World Table 9.1 for the
period of 1990-2017. I derive real investment index by dividing nominal
investment index with producer price index(ppi). All variables are
yearly and detrended by HP-filter. As we can see in Figure 1, most of
the variables shows strong comovements, but the real investment index
have shown a bit higher volatility compared to other variables.

In Figure 2, I investigated the sector-level volatilities in agriculture
and manufacturing by using BOK yearly data for the period of 2009-2019.
All variables are detrended by HP-filter. Unfortunately, the
volatilities of gdp and hours have not shown strong comovements in both
sector. However, due to the data limitation, I cannot generalize that
these low comovements in both sectors can be applied to the extended
period or other industry.
